## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project analyzes a large-scale Amazon product review dataset to:
- Explore rating trends, distribution, and user behavior
- Build a **popularity-based recommendation engine**
- Build an **item-based collaborative filtering model** using `scikit-surprise`
- Visualize top-rated products and understand rating skewness
- Perform **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to reduce dimensionality and recommend similar products
